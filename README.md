## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository contains:
- A Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and model training
- Multiple ML models trained and evaluated for price prediction
- Clustering analysis to segment diamonds into groups
- A **Streamlit web application** (`app.py`) to:
  - Predict diamond price (INR)
  - Predict diamond market segment (cluster)
